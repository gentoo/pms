\label{ch:glossary}

This chapter contains explanations of some of the terms used in this document whose meaning may not
be immediately obvious.

\begin{description}
\item[qualified package name] A package name along with its associated category. For example,
    \t{app-editors/vim} is a qualified package name.
\item[new-style virtual] A new-style virtual is a normal package in the \t{virtual} category which
    installs no files and uses its dependency requirements to pull in a `provider'. Historically,
    old-style virtuals required special handling from the package manager; new-style virtuals do
    not.
\item[stand-alone repository] An (ebuild) repository which is intended to function on its own as the
    only, or primary, repository on a system. Contrast with \i{slave repository} below.
\item[slave repository, non-stand-alone repository] An (ebuild) repository which is not complete
    enough to function on its own, but needs one or more \i{master repositories} to
    satisfy dependencies and provide repository-level support files. Known in Portage as an overlay.
\item[master repository] See above.
