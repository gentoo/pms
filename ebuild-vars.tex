\chapter{Ebuild-defined Variables}
\label{ebuild-vars}

\note This section describes variables that may or must be defined by ebuilds. For
variables that are passed from the package manager to the ebuild, see section \ref{ebuild-env-vars}.

\section{Mandatory Ebuild-defined Variables}

All ebuilds must define at least the following variables:

\begin{description}
\item[DESCRIPTION] A short human-readable description of the package's purpose. May be defined by an
    eclass.
\item[SRC\_URI] A list of source URIs for the package. Valid protocols are \t{http://},
    \t{https://}, \t{ftp://} and \t{mirror://\} (see section \{thirdpartymirrors} for mirror behaviour).
    Fetch restricted packages may include URL parts consisting of just a filename.  Use-conditional and
    All-of groups are allowed; other constructs, such as any-of groups, are forbidden. May be defined by
    an eclass, and may be empty.
\item[HOMEPAGE] The package's homepage or (whitespace separated) homepages, including protocol. May
    be defined by an eclass.
\item[SLOT] The package's slot. Must be a valid slot name, as per section \ref{slot-names}. May
    be defined by an eclass.
\item[LICENSE] The package's license. Each text token must correspond to a tree ``licenses/`` entry
    (see section \ref{licenses-dir}). Use-conditional, any-of and all-of groups are allowed.
    May be defined by an eclass.
\item[IUSE] The \t{USE} flags used by the ebuild. Historically, \t{USE\_EXPAND} values were not
    included; package managers should support this for backwards compatibility reasons. Ebuilds
    should list only flags used by the ebuild itself. Any eclass that works with \t{USE} flags
    should also set \t{IUSE}, listing only the variables used by that eclass. The package manager is
    responsible for merging these values.
\item[KEYWORDS] A whitespace separated list of keywords for the ebuild. Each token must be a
    valid keyword name, as per section \ref{keyword-names}. May include $-*$, which
    indicates that the package will only work on explicitly listed archs. May include $-arch$,
    which indicates that the package will not work on the specified arch.
\end{description}

If any of these variables are undefined, or if any of these variables are set to invalid values,
the package manager's behaviour is undefined; ideally, an error in one ebuild should not prevent
operations upon other ebuilds or packages.

\section{Optional Ebuild-defined Variables}

Ebuilds may define any of the following variables:

\begin{description}
\item[S] The path to the temporary build directory, used by \t{src\_compile}, \t{src\_install}
    etc. Defaults to \t{\$\{WORKDIR\}/\$\{P\}}.
\item[DEPEND] See section \ref{dependencies}.
\item[RDEPEND] See section \ref{dependencies}.
\item[PDEPEND] See section \ref{dependencies}.
\item[PROVIDE] Any \e{old style} virtuals provided by this package. May contain use conditionals.
\item[EAPI] The EAPI, by default \t{0}.
\item[INHERITED] List of inherited eclass names. This is handled magically by \t{inherit} and
    shouldn't be modified manually.
\item[RESTRICT] Zero or more of \t{mirror}, \t{fetch}, \t{strip}. Package managers may recognise
    other values, but ebuilds may not rely upon them being supported.
\end{description}

If any of these variables are set to invalid values, the package manager's behaviour is undefined;
ideally, an error in one ebuild should not prevent operations upon other ebuilds or packages.
