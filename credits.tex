\section*{Reporting Issues}

Issues (inaccuracies, wording problems, omissions etc.)\ in this document should be reported via
Gentoo Bugzilla using product \e{Gentoo Hosted Projects}, component \e{PMS/EAPI} and the default
assignee. There should be one bug per issue, and one issue per bug.

Patches (in \t{git format-patch} form if possible) may be submitted either via Bugzilla or to the

the following:

\begin{compactitem}
\item Accept and apply the patch.
\item Explain why the patch cannot be applied as-is. The patch may then be updated and resubmitted
if \mbox{appropriate}.
\item Reject the patch outright.
\item Take special action merited by the individual circumstances.
\end{compactitem}

When reporting issues, remember that this document is not the appropriate place for pushing

If any issue cannot be resolved by the PMS team, it may be escalated to the Gentoo Council.
