\chapter{Ebuild File Format}
\label{ebuild-format}

The ebuild file format is in its basic form a subset of the format of a bash script. The interpreter
is assumed to be GNU bash, version 3.0 or later. The file encoding must be UTF-8 with Unix-style
newlines. When sourced, the
ebuild must define certain variables and functions (see sections~\ref{ebuild-vars} and
\ref{ebuild-functions} for specific information), and must not call any external programs, write
anything to standard output or standard error, or modify the state of the system in any way.
