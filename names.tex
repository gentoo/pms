\chapter{Names and Versions}

\section{Names}

No name may be empty. Package managers must not impose fixed upper boundaries upon the length of any
name.

\subsection{Category Names}
A category name may contain any of the characters [\t{A-Za-z0-9+\_.-}]. It must not begin with
a hyphen or a dot.

\subsection{Package Names}
A package name may contain any of the characters [\t{A-Za-z0-9+\_-}]. It must not begin with a
hyphen, and must not end in a hyphen followed by one or more digits.

\note A package name does not include the category. The term \i{qualified package name} is used
where a \t{category/package} pair is meant.

\subsection{Slot Names}
\label{slot-names}
A slot name may contain any of the characters [\t{A-Za-z0-9+\_.-}]. It must not begin with a
hyphen or a dot.

\subsection{USE Flag Names}
A USE flag name may contain any of the characters [\t{A-Za-z0-9+\_@:-}]. It must not start with
a hyphen. Underscores are reserved for \t{USE\_EXPAND}, as described in section
\ref{use-expand}.

\subsection{Repository Names}
\label{repository-names}
A repository name may contain any of the characters [\t{A-Za-z0-9\_-}]. It must not begin with a
hyphen.

\subsection{Keyword Names}
\label{keyword-names}
A keyword name may contain any of the characters [\t{A-Za-z0-9\_-}]. It must not begin with a
hyphen or a dot. In contexts where it makes sense to do so, a keyword name may be prefixed by
a tilde or a hyphen. In some contexts, $-*$ is also acceptable as a keyword.

\section{Version Specifications}
Version specifications are given as ordered integer tuples, separated by decimal points, with any or
none of the following suffixes in this order:
\begin{bulletlist}
\item One of the letters [\t{a-z}].
\item One of \t{\_alpha}, \t{\_beta}, \t{\_pre}, \t{\_rc}, and \t{\_p}, optionally followed by an
    integer. If the integer is omitted, it is assumed to be 0.
\item The string \t{-r} followed immediately by an integer (the ``revision number''). If this section
    is not present, it is assumed to be \t{-r0}.
\end{bulletlist}

\section{Version Comparison}

Version specifications are compared using strict integer comparison, moving left to right. \t{2.10}
is newer than \t{2.9}, which is newer than \t{1.500}. Any numeric value is newer than none, so
\t{1.0.0} is newer than \t{1.0} (and, by extension, \t{1.0.0\_alpha} is newer than \t{1.0}).
If the numeric parts are found to be equal, the suffixes above are considered, in the order listed.

Letter suffixes are compared alphabetically, with any letter being newer than no letter.

If letters are equal, the next part is considered. The ordering of this is complex: \t{\_alpha} is
older than \t{\_beta}, which is older than \t{\_pre}, which is older than \t{\_rc}, which is older
than no suffix, which is older than \t{\_p}. If the two versions being compared have the same
suffix, the associated integer is compared.

If at this point the two versions are still equal, the revision number is compared. If the revision
numbers are equal, so are the two versions.
