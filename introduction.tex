\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Aims and Motivation}
This document aims to document fully the format of an ebuild repository and the ebuilds therein, as
well as certain aspects of package manager behaviour required to support such a repository. The
reason is simple: at present the only definition of what an ebuild can assume about its environment,
the only definition of what is valid in an ebuild, is the source code of the latest Portage release
and a general consensus about which features are too new to assume availability. This has several
drawbacks: not only is it impossible to change any aspect of Portage behaviour without verifying
that nothing in the tree relies upon it, but if a new package manager should appear it becomes
impossible to fully support such an ill-defined standard. This document aims to address both of
these concerns by defining almost all aspects of what an ebuild repository looks like, and how an
ebuild is allowed to behave. Thus, both Portage and other package managers can change aspects of
their behaviour not defined here without worry of incompatibilities with any particular repository.

\section{Conventions}
Text in \t{teletype} is used for filenames or variable names. \i{Italic} text is used for terms
whose meaning may not be obvious to someone without specific prior knowledge, though a good
knowledge of ebuild development is assumed throughout. Most of these terms are explained in the
Glossary in chapter \ref{glossary}.
