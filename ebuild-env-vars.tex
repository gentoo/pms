\subsection{Globally Defined Variables}
\label{global-ebuild-vars}

The following variables are available, read-only, in all phases of the ebuild environment. They
should not be modified by ebuild code.
\begin{description}
\item[P] Package name and version, without the revision part. For example, \t{vim-7.0.174}.
\item[PN] Package name, for example \t{vim}.
\item[PV] Package version, for example \t{7.0.174}.
\item[PR] Package revision, or \t{r0} if none exists.
\item[PVR] Package version and revision, for example \t{7.0.174-r0} or \t{7.0.174-r1}.
\item[PF] Package name, version, and revision, for example \t{vim-7.0.174-r1}.
\item[A] All source files available for the package. Does not include any that are disabled because
    of USE conditionals. The value is calculated from the base names of each element of the
    \t{SRC\_URI} ebuild metadata variable.
\item[AA] All source files that could be available for the package, including any that are disabled
    in \t{A} because of USE conditionals. The value is calculated from the base names of each element
    of the \t{SRC\_URI} ebuild metadata variable.
\item[CATEGORY] The package's category, for example \t{app-editors}.
\item[FILESDIR] The full path to the package's files directory, used for small support files or
    patches. See section \ref{package-dirs}.
\item[WORKDIR] The full path to the ebuild's working directory, in which all build data should be
    contained.
\item[T] The full path to a temporary directory for use by the ebuild.
\item[USE] A whitespace-delimited list of all active USE flags for this ebuild, including those
    originating from variables in \t{USE\_EXPAND}.
\item[] All variables set in the active profiles' \t{make.defaults} files will be exported to the
    ebuild environment.
\item[HOME] The full path to an appropriate temporary directory for use by any programs invoked by
    the ebuild that may read or modify the home directory.
\item[PATH] Must contain at least \t{/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin} and any directories required
    by the package manager.
\end{description}

\subsection{Phase-specific variables}

In addition to the global list in section \ref{global-ebuild-vars}, there are several extra
variables available in specific ebuild phases.

\subsubsection{src\_install}
\begin{description}
\item[D] Contains the full path to the image directory into which the package should be installed.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{pkg\_preinst}
\begin{description}
\item[IMAGE] Contains the full path to the image directory of the package about to be merged.
